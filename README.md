# IOS-UIAlertViewsIOS
Showing different ALERT views in IOS using Objective C

Note:

1) UIAlertView is deprecated in IOS 9 onwards. Hence, it is recommended to use UIAlertController.
2) This project describes the usage of the following:

UIAlertView -- Showing Alert and adding an action and invoking it.
UIAlertController -- Showing Alert, Dismissing it, adding action and callback to the action.
UIAlertController with ActionSheet -- Showing the actions vertically stacked in ActionSheet.
UIAlertController with Actionsheet and text fields -- showing the addition of text fields in an alertview.
